# PHYS-CS-5_Intro-to-Embedded-Prototyping Syllabus

## Course Material

A lab format class where students learn the skills needed to bring hardware ideas to life. 

The class will introduce on Python-based coding of microcontrollers, single-board computers (SBC), hardware communication, IP network communication, breadboarding, PCB design, and oscilloscope use, with a five week individual project-based final. 


## Lecture and Lab
The combined lecture and lab is on Friday from 10 AM to 12:20 PM in Phelps 2536.
Please note that the lab is open every day from **10-7 pm**. 

Students in Phys 127BL have sections MTWR 2:00 - 4:20 PM. Please be mindful and give students priority if you are planning to come in during that time.   

Potential office hours would also be held in Phelps 2536, TBD.

## Assignments + Grading Breakdown
Lab write-ups: One for each of the first 5 weeks. Total 50% (10% each). Due at latest Friday before next class (details TBD).

Final project: 50% (Week 10 presentation, deliverables will be described in the future)

This class is Pass/No Pass. The expectation is that you show up to every week of class and try to finish all of the assignments in the labs. 
Lab write-ups can be done in Google Docs, should be timestamped (chronology) and contain photos/screenshots/diagrams of experiment. 

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g8SAbs5IwasIHW8Z84ER9CFT5S0tL8PVK3XkffxOYgc/edit?usp=sharing) is an example lab writeup I did for 127AL. It does not have to be as long but should include some bulets for goals and conclusions.
